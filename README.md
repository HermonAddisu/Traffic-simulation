# Traffic-simulation
A simpler version of simulation of traffic flow

## Description
This project aims to simulate simple traffic flow at an intersection using python so that children can easily understand traffic lights. 

## Setup instructions
1). Clone the repository using: 'git clone https://github.com/HermonAddisu/traffic-simulation.git
2). Navigate into the project folder: cd traffic-simulation
3) Run the project: python main.py

## Features
The traffic simulation project includes the following key features:

- **Traffic Light Control:** 
  - The simulation implements a realistic traffic light system that cycles through green, yellow, and red lights. This controls the flow of vehicles at intersections, mimicking real-world traffic patterns.

- **Vehicle Movement Simulation:** 
  - Vehicles are generated randomly and move according to traffic rules. The simulation incorporates acceleration, and stopping behavior at traffic lights and stop signs.

- **Interactive User Interface:** 
  - The project features a user-friendly interface built with Python's Turtle graphics. Users can visually observe the interactions between vehicles and traffic signals.

- **Built-in Modules:** 
  - The project utilizes Python's built-in modules such as:
    - Turtle: For creating the graphical interface and visualizing the simulation.
    - Random: To generate random vehicle spawn times and movement patterns, adding variability to the simulation.
    - Math
